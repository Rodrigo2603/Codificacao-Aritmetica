To compress a file (other than `teste.txt`) you need to:

- Put the file in the same folder as `codificacao_aritmetica.py`
- Change the name of the file in `line 56`
- Run `codificacao_aritmetica.py`

The output is an array that contains the numbers of that file compressed with a integer arithmetic algorithm
